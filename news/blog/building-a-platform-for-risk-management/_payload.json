When Flink detects the failure, it will automatically restart the operator on another available compute resource, restoring the last known checkpointed state from T1, and reprocessing events that have not been checkpointed yet. Furthermore, if the sink to which P&L is written provides transactional semantics, then end-to-end exactly-once processing semantics can be achieved via Flink. It is this fault-tolerance mechanism that provides the data consistency and correctness attributes required to run a risk system at scale.","2507a563de7b0",{"markDefs":482,"children":483,"_type":50,"style":141,"_key":488},[],[484],{"_type":47,"marks":485,"text":486,"_key":487},[147],"Processing at scale","3cf24335cec00","3cf24335cec0",{"children":490,"_type":50,"style":51,"_key":495,"markDefs":496},[491],{"_type":47,"marks":492,"text":493,"_key":494},[],"Not all calculations in a risk system are the same.

The JobManager then assigns tasks for each of these operators to available task slots on a TaskManager. One key role performed by the JobManager is to determine how to divide tasks for a given operator so that they can be executed in parallel. The level to which this occurs can be configured via a parallelism parameter. In a Beam application that runs on Flink, this can only be set to one value for all operators in the application. For example, setting this parameter to 32 means that each operator used in the application will be executed in 32 different task slots in parallel. However, while setting this parameter will create 32 task slots for each operator in the execution graph, those slots will not be utilized efficiently unless the sources and sinks of the application can also support that level of parallelism.","7d7afc2807740",[],{"markDefs":558,"children":559,"_type":50,"style":51,"_key":563},[],[560],{"_type":47,"marks":561,"text":22,"_key":562},[],"5edf9aab96a60","5edf9aab96a6",{"markDefs":565,"children":566,"_type":50,"style":51,"_key":571},[],[567],{"_type":47,"marks":568,"text":569,"_key":570},[],"To that end, we make heavy use of Apache Kafka to achieve our desired rate of parallelism.
